IMP: outstanding classification

Forward ports are now considered "outstanding" if *they* were created more than
~a week ago, previously they would be counted as outstanding if their source was
merged more than a week ago (so for difficult forward ports they'd all be
considered outstanding leading to unnecessary reminders).
